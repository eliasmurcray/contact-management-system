# Contact Managment System

This is my first C project. I created it using a spec (found in spec.md) which I requested from ChatGPT to help me learn the basics of C.

## Building

To build this project clone the repo and run `gcc main.c -o main` to generate the executable. Then, run `./main` to begin the script.

You will be presented with a few options, each of which either manipulates the user data or displays it. You can press 5 to exit or just cancel the command.
