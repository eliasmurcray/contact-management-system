**Project: Simple Contact Management System in C**

1. **Objective:**
   Develop a basic contact management system in C that allows users to add, view, search, and delete contacts.

2. **Functionalities:**
   - **Add Contact:** Users can add a new contact by entering details such as name, phone number, and email address.
   - **View Contacts:** Display a list of all contacts with their details.
   - **Search Contact:** Users can search for a contact by name or phone number and display its details.
   - **Delete Contact:** Allow users to delete a contact by specifying its name or phone number.

3. **Data Structure:**
   Define a structure to represent a contact with fields such as name, phone number, and email address.

4. **Storage:**
   Use an array of structures or dynamic memory allocation to store contacts.

5. **User Interface:**
   Implement a text-based user interface to interact with users. Display a menu of options (add, view, search, delete, exit) and prompt users for inputs accordingly.

6. **Error Handling:**
   Include basic error handling to manage scenarios such as a full contact list, searching for a non-existent contact, etc.

7. **Example Scenarios:**

   - *Adding a Contact:*
     - User selects "Add Contact" from the menu.
     - User inputs contact details (name, phone, email).
     - Contact is added to the contact list.

   - *Viewing Contacts:*
     - User selects "View Contacts" from the menu.
     - All contacts with their details are displayed on the screen.

   - *Searching for a Contact:*
     - User selects "Search Contact" from the menu.
     - User inputs the name or phone number to search for.
     - If the contact exists, its details are displayed; otherwise, a message indicating "Contact not found" is shown.

   - *Deleting a Contact:*
     - User selects "Delete Contact" from the menu.
     - User inputs the name or phone number of the contact to be deleted.
     - If the contact exists, it is removed from the contact list; otherwise, a message indicating "Contact not found" is displayed.

8. **Expansion Options:**
   - Implement file handling to save contacts to a file for persistence.
   - Add additional functionalities such as updating contacts or sorting contacts alphabetically.

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience with fundamental concepts in C programming, including structures, arrays, functions, loops, and user input/output handling. It can be extended and customized based on your proficiency level and interest in further exploring C programming features.
